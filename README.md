# Flight-Planner-.NET-MAUI
Useful tools for pilots! (Refreshed last Flight Planner project, this time built with C#)

Another version of the same project posted here in my repositories, but now making use of C# and more powerful resouces.
The project currently reads and stores favorite locations in a local file, fetches actual weather and forecast, and has
a tab with a built-in PDF reader, which will be useful to check generated weight and balance charts.

UNDER DEVELOPMENT...!
