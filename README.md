# Flight-Planner-.NET-MAUI
Useful tools for pilots! (Refreshed last Flight Planner project, this time built with C#)

Another version of the same project posted here in my repositories, but now making use of C# and more powerful resouces.
The project currently reads and stores favorite locations in a local file, fetches actual weather and forecast, and has
a tab with a built-in PDF reader, which will be useful to check generated weight and balance charts. It is also possible
to check all information about an airport in the tab "Rotaer". The tab displays a webview consuming a html response from the API.
Future improvements will include distance calculator between airports and waypoints, radar images and NOTAMs (notice to air men).

UNDER DEVELOPMENT...!
